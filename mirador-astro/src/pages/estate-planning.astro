				<p>
					Upon your death, the balance of your registered accounts such as your Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) or Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF), can be transferred on a tax-deferred to your spouse or a child that is financially dependent because of an impairment in physical or mental function, if they are named as the beneficiary. Taxes will be owed in the future as amounts are withdrawn from the RRSP or RRIF.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without a spouse or dependent child named as the beneficiary, the balance of the registered account goes to the estate and the full amount will be taxed at the time of your death.    This will have a significant adverse impact on the amount of wealth you are leaving to your beneficiaries.

      title: "Naming a Successor Annuitant",
      content: `
				<p>
          You can also name your spouse as a successor annuitant of your RRIF (but not your RRSP) instead of naming them as a beneficiary. In this instance, they receive income from the RRIF each year until their death, at which time the balance of the RRIF will pass to the beneficiary you have named, such as your children.  This strategy is often used in second marriages and allows you to take care of your spouse as long as they are alive, and gives you control over who receives the residual value.

      title: "Timing Withdrawals from your RRSPs and RRIFs",
      content: `
				<p>
          It often makes sense to delay withdrawals from your RRSP or RRIF as long as possible to defer tax and maximize the amount of capital working for you. However, there are times when it makes sense to withdraw amounts from your RRSPs or RRIFs earlier such as when you are in a lower income tax bracket or to minimize the Old Age Security (OAS) claw back.   Similarly, it might make sense to withdraw funds from your RRIF to make your annual TFSA contribution.
